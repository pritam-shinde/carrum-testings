                            Letâ€™s face it; we all would like to own a set of perfect looking teeth. However, due to various reasons, a majority of people never really feel confident with their smiles. The effects
                            can be both psychologically and socially damaging. So, why do most people shy away from seeking treatment to correct crooked, unsightly gaps, or crowding? Well, it turns out that one
                            major reason is the fear of using traditional metal braces.

                                Invisalign is a modern solution that helps you straighten your teeth without using traditional metal braces. Your dentist will use clear, smooth, and durable plastic to make a

                                them after every two weeks for your teeth to slowly get into position.
